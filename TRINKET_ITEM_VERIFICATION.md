## Conditional/Special Effects (Marked as conditional: true)

The following trinkets and items have effects that cannot be statically modeled because they depend on gameplay conditions:

### Trinkets
- Alarm (panic mode)
- Bone (on item pickup)
- Clown Horn (odd floors)
- Ribbon Spool (even floors)
- Vanity Mirror (panic mode)
- Pull Toy (new floor)
- Star Pillow (while extracting)
- Feather Duster (on item pickup)
- Peppermint Icing (after ability use)
- Friendship Bracelet (varies by team size)
- All highlighting/special effect trinkets

### Items
- Healing items (Bandage, Health Kit)
- Instant effects (Bottle o' Pop, Pop, Jumper Cable, Valve)
- Currency items (Basket, Ichor, Ornament, Pumpkin, Tapes)
- Random effects (Gumballs, Jawbreaker)
- Special mechanics (Smoke Bomb)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dog Plush vs Pink Bow
- **Dog Plush**: Should only increase walk speed by 10%, run speed unchanged
- **Pink Bow**: Should only increase run speed by 7.5%, walk speed unchanged
- **Both together**: Walk speed +10%, Run speed +7.5%

### Scenario 2: Stamina Trinkets
- **Speedometer**: +15 stamina (additive)
- **Cooler**: +50 stamina (additive), -5% movement speed
- **Both together**: +65 stamina, -5% movement speed

### Scenario 3: Skill Check Trinkets
- **Magnifying Glass**: +1.75 skill check amount (additive), -33% skill check size
- **Thinking Cap**: +40 skill check size (additive)
- **Both together**: +1.75 skill check amount, +40 skill check size, -33% skill check size (net: ~+26.8 skill check size)

### Scenario 4: Multiple Items
- **Speed Candy x2**: 25% + 25% = 56.25% total movement speed boost (1.25 * 1.25 = 1.5625)
- **Extraction Speed Candy x3**: 50% + 50% + 50% = 237.5% total extraction speed boost (1.5^3 = 3.375)

## Calculator Logic Verification

### Multiplicative Effects
```javascript
// Multiplicative effects stack multiplicatively
// Formula: final = base * (1 + mod1) * (1 + mod2) * ...
// Example: base 10, +50%, +25%
// final = 10 * 1.5 * 1.25 = 18.75
```

### Additive Effects
```javascript
// Additive effects sum first, then apply to base
// Formula: final = (base + add1 + add2 + ...) * multiplicative
// Example: base 100, +50, +15, then *1.1
// final = (100 + 50 + 15) * 1.1 = 181.5
```

### Walk/Run Speed Handling
```javascript
// movementSpeed modifiers apply to both walk and run
// walkSpeed modifiers apply only to walk
// runSpeed modifiers apply only to run
// Final: walkSpeed gets both, runSpeed gets both
```

## Summary

✅ **57 trinkets reviewed** - All permanent effects properly implemented
✅ **27 items reviewed** - All temporary effects properly implemented
✅ **Calculator extended** - Support for walk-only, run-only, and additive modifiers
✅ **Effect mapping** - All targetStat values properly mapped
✅ **Conditional effects** - Properly marked and excluded from calculation

All trinket and item effects are now correctly implemented according to their descriptions.
