2. **Column 2 (Middle)**: Trinkets
   - Filter dropdown (by effect category)
   - Scrollable checkbox list of ALL trinkets
   - No 2-trinket limit - users can select as many as they want to experiment
   - Shows trinket name and effect inline

3. **Column 3 (Right)**: Team Composition
   - 7 compact team member dropdowns (no labels, just dropdowns)
   - Team abilities checkboxes (compact)
   - Active items with counters (compact)

### Row 2: 2 Columns (2:1 ratio)
1. **Twisted Speed Comparison (spans 2/3 width)**
   - Compact table with abbreviated headers (W/R for Walk/Run)
   - Sorted by fastest (panic run) by default
   - Inline color legend (Safe/Caution/Danger)
   - Minimal spacing

2. **Machine Extraction (spans 1/3 width)**
   - Compact display with short labels
   - Skill check slider
   - Shows base, buffed, and final times

## Key Changes Made

### Visual/Layout:
- ✅ Full-width layout (no max-width containers)
- ✅ 3-column grid for main content
- ✅ Reduced spacing throughout (--spacing-sm instead of --spacing-lg)
- ✅ Compact font sizes (0.85rem - 0.9rem for most UI)
- ✅ Smaller padding on all panels
- ✅ Shortened stat names (Walk instead of Walk Speed)
- ✅ Abbreviated table headers (W/R instead of Walk/Run)

### Functional:
- ✅ Trinkets changed from 2 dropdowns to checkbox list
- ✅ Trinket filtering by effect category
- ✅ No trinket selection limit
- ✅ Default sort by fastest Twisted (descending panic run speed)
- ✅ Conditional stats moved under toon selection
- ✅ Team dropdowns simplified (no "Member 1:" labels)

### Typography:
- ✅ All headings use **Fredoka One** font
- ✅ Main logo uses **ITC Kabel** (with fallbacks)
- ✅ Consistent font family throughout UI

## Files Modified

1. `index.html` - Complete restructure with new 3-column + 2-row layout
2. `css/main.css` - Added full-width containers, 3-column grid, compact styles
3. `css/responsive.css` - Updated breakpoints for new layout
4. `css/components.css` - (minimal changes needed)

## Files That Need Updates

The following JS files will need updates to handle the new structure:
1. `js/ui.js` - Update trinket population to use checkboxes, add filter logic
2. `js/app.js` - Update event handlers for trinket checkboxes and filter
3. `js/calculator.js` - (no changes needed, works with any number of trinkets)

## Next Steps

To make the interface fully functional with the new layout:
1. Update `UI.populateTrinketList()` to create checkbox list
2. Add `UI.filterTrinkets()` function
3. Update `App.attachEventListeners()` for trinket checkboxes
4. Add `App.handleTrinketToggle()` function
5. Add `App.handleTrinketFilter()` function
6. Update default sort order to descending by panic run speed
