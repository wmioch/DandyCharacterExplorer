- **"Cancola (Pop)"** - Just another name for "Bottle o' Pop" (duplicate listing)
- **"Enigma Candy"** - Deleted item, replaced by Jawbreaker (no longer in game)
- **"event currency"** - Section header

### Counted (26 items)

## Key Clarification: Stopwatch vs Skill Check Candy

These are **TWO SEPARATE, DISTINCT ITEMS**:

| Item | Effect | Duration | Cost | Rarity | Dandy's Shop? |
|------|--------|----------|------|--------|---------------|
| **Stopwatch** | Increases skill check **range** by 50 | 15 seconds | 18 tapes | Common | ✅ Yes (exclusive) |
| **Skill Check Candy** | Increases skill check **size** by 25% | 8 seconds | 40 tapes | Uncommon | ❌ No (spawns anywhere) |

**Key Differences:**
- Different effects (range vs size)
- Different durations (15s vs 8s)
- Different costs (18 vs 40 tapes)
- Different rarities (Common vs Uncommon)
- Stopwatch is Dandy's Shop exclusive, Skill Check Candy is not
