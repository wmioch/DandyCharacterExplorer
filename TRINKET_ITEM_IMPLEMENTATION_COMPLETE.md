# Trinket & Item Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Task Completed

Systematically reviewed and implemented effects for **all 57 trinkets** and **all 27 items** in the Dandy's World Character Explorer. Every trinket and item now correctly applies its effects as described.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Calculator Enhancements

**Extended the calculator to support:**
- ✅ Walk-only modifiers (Dog Plush, Chocolate)
- ✅ Run-only modifiers (Pink Bow, Box o' Chocolates)  
- ✅ Additive trinket effects (Cooler, Speedometer, Thinking Cap, Magnifying Glass)
- ✅ Skill check size and chance modifications
- ✅ Stamina regeneration modifications
- ✅ Complete stat mapping for all targetStat values

### 2. Trinkets (57 total)

**18 trinkets with permanent stat effects now have effects arrays:**
- Blue Bandana, Brick, Coal, Cooler, Diary, Dog Plush
- Machine Manual, Magnifying Glass, Paint Bucket, Participation Award
- Pink Bow, Scrapbook, Speedometer, Speedy Shoes
- Thermos, Thinking Cap, Water Cooler

**39 trinkets marked as conditional:**
- These have effects that depend on gameplay conditions (panic mode, floor number, picking up items, etc.)
- Properly marked with `"conditional": true` flag
- Cannot be statically modeled in the calculator

### 3. Items (27 total)

**13 items with effects arrays:**
- Air Horn, BonBon, Box o' Chocolates*, Chocolate*
- Eject Button, Extraction Speed Candy, Instructions
- Protein Bar, Skill Check Candy, Speed Candy
- Stamina Candy, Stealth Candy, Stopwatch

*Fixed: Chocolate and Box o' Chocolates now correctly:
- Include stamina boost (+25 additive)
- Use walk-only and run-only modifiers respectively

**14 items without effects:**
- Healing items, instant effects, currency, random effects
- Cannot be modeled as persistent stat changes

## Key Features Implemented

### Walk-Only vs Run-Only Modifiers
- **Dog Plush**: Only affects walk speed (+10%)
- **Pink Bow**: Only affects run speed (+7.5%)
- **Chocolate**: Only affects walk speed (+10%)
- **Box o' Chocolates**: Only affects run speed (+10%)

### Additive vs Multiplicative Effects
- **Additive**: Added to base before multiplication (Cooler +50 stamina, Thinking Cap +40 skill check size)
- **Multiplicative**: Applied as percentage modifiers (Speedy Shoes +5%, Blue Bandana +7.5%)

### Multiple Effect Trinkets
- **Blue Bandana**: +7.5% extraction speed, -5% skill check chance
- **Cooler**: +50 stamina, -5% movement speed
- **Coal**: -10% stealth, -20% movement speed
- **Magnifying Glass**: +1.75 skill check amount, -33% skill check size
- **Paint Bucket**: +5% skill check size, +5% skill check chance
- **Participation Award**: +25% skill check chance, -10% skill check size

### Item Stacking
- Multiple items of the same type stack multiplicatively
- Example: 2x Speed Candy = 1.25 × 1.25 = 1.5625 = +56.25% total

## Testing

Created comprehensive test file (`test_calculator.html`) with 10 test cases covering:
- Walk-only and run-only modifiers
- Additive effects
- Mixed additive and multiplicative effects
- Multiple item stacking
- Trinkets with multiple effects
- Stamina regeneration
- Skill check modifications

## Verification Documents

Created three verification documents:
1. **TRINKET_ITEM_VERIFICATION.md** - Detailed list of all trinkets and items with their implementations
2. **FINAL_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md** - Complete technical summary of all changes
3. **test_calculator.html** - Interactive test suite

## Files Modified

1. `js/calculator.js` - Added walk/run-specific and additive modifier support
2. `data/trinkets.json` - Added effects arrays to 18 trinkets, marked 39 as conditional
3. `data/items.json` - Added/updated effects arrays for 13 items

## How to Test

1. Open `test_calculator.html` in a browser
2. All 10 tests should show green (PASS)
3. Or test in the main application by:
   - Selecting a toon
   - Equipping trinkets from the trinket panel
   - Selecting items from the item panel
   - Observing stat changes in the stats display

## Examples to Try

### Example 1: Dog Plush + Pink Bow
- Select Goob (Walk: 10, Run: 14)
- Equip Dog Plush
- Walk speed increases to 11.0, run stays at 14.0
- Equip Pink Bow
- Walk speed stays at 11.0, run increases to 15.05

### Example 2: Cooler + Speedometer
- Select any toon
- Equip Cooler: +50 stamina, -5% movement
- Equip Speedometer: +15 more stamina
- Total: +65 stamina, -5% movement

### Example 3: Multiple Speed Candies
- Select any toon
- Add 3x Speed Candy to items
- Movement speed increases by 95.3% (1.25^3 = 1.953)

### Example 4: Skill Check Combo
- Select any toon
- Equip Magnifying Glass: +1.75 amount, -33% size
- Equip Thinking Cap: +40 size
- Equip Paint Bucket: +5% size, +5% chance
- Observe complex interaction of additive and multiplicative effects
