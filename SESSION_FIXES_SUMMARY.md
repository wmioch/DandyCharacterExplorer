# Session Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made in this session.

## Fix 1: Alarm Trinket (and 4 other conditional trinkets)

### Problem
Alarm trinket (and similar conditional trinkets) were marked as `conditional: true` but had no effects arrays, so they showed no stat changes when selected.

### Solution
Added effects arrays to 5 conditional trinkets with quantifiable stat bonuses:

| Trinket | Effect | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Alarm** | +25% movement during Panic Mode | ✅ FIXED |
| **Pull Toy** | +25% movement when floor starts | ✅ FIXED |
| **Clown Horn** | +10% movement on odd floors | ✅ FIXED |
| **Ribbon Spool** | +10% movement on even floors | ✅ FIXED |
| **Vanity Mirror** | +30% run during Panic Mode | ✅ FIXED |

### Files Modified
- `data/trinkets.json` - Added effects arrays to 5 trinkets

## Fix 2: Blue Bandana Issues

### Problem 1: Skill Check Chance Calculation Incorrect
- **Was**: 25% × 0.95 = 23.75% (multiplicative)
- **Should be**: 25% - 5% = 20% (additive)

### Problem 2: Extraction Speed Showing 7% Instead of 7.5%
- **Was**: Floating point precision caused `Math.round(7.499...996)` to return 7
- **Should be**: 7.5% rounds to 8%

### Solution
1. Changed skill check effect from `multiplicative` to `additive`
2. Added epsilon (`0.00001`) to percentage rounding to fix floating point precision

### Files Modified
- `data/trinkets.json` - Changed Blue Bandana skill check to additive
- `js/calculator.js` - Added epsilon to `_calculatePercentage()` rounding

### Test Results
```
Goob with Blue Bandana:
  Extraction Speed: 1.0 → 1.1 (+8%)  ✅
  Skill Check Chance: 25% → 20% (-5%)  ✅
```

## Fix 3: Bone Trinket - Complete Implementation

### Problem 1: Bone does nothing
**Solution**: Added effects array with +25% movement speed

### Problem 2: Bone should be stackable
**Solution**: Implemented full trinket stacking system
- Left-click to increment (max 10 stacks)
- Right-click to decrement (removes at 0)
- Count badges show stack count
- Each stack adds +25% movement speed

### Problem 3: Bone needs 40 speed cap
**Solution**: Added cap support to prevent speed exceeding 40

### Implementation Highlights

#### Data Changes
```json
{
  "name": "Bone",
  "stackable": true,
  "effects": [
    {
      "targetStat": "movementSpeed",
      "value": 0.25,
      "applicationType": "multiplicative",
      "cap": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Calculator Changes
- Updated trinket processing to handle `{trinket, count}` format
- Apply effects multiple times for stackable trinkets
- Use existing cap logic (already supported)

#### App State Changes
- Added `handleTrinketIncrement()` and `handleTrinketDecrement()`
- Modified `handleTrinketToggle()` to check `stackable` flag
- Added right-click event listener for trinket list

#### UI Changes
- Updated `updateSelectedTrinketsInGrid()` to show count badges
- Count badges use existing `.count-badge` CSS class

### Test Results
```
Goob with Bone stacks:
  1 stack: Walk 21.9, Run 34.4  ✅
  2 stacks: Walk 27.3, Run 40.0 (capped)  ✅
  3 stacks: Walk 34.2, Run 40.0 (capped)  ✅
```

### Files Modified
- `data/trinkets.json` - Added stackable flag and effects to Bone
- `js/calculator.js` - Updated trinket processing for stacking/caps
- `js/app.js` - Added trinket count handling and event listeners
- `js/ui.js` - Updated UI to show count badges

---

## Summary of All Files Modified

1. **data/trinkets.json**
   - Added effects arrays to 6 trinkets (Alarm, Pull Toy, Clown Horn, Ribbon Spool, Vanity Mirror, Bone)
   - Changed Blue Bandana skill check from multiplicative to additive
   - Added `stackable: true` flag to Bone

2. **js/calculator.js**
   - Added epsilon to `_calculatePercentage()` for floating point precision fix
   - Updated trinket processing to handle stacking (`{trinket, count}` format)

3. **js/app.js**
   - Updated state comment for `equippedTrinkets`
   - Modified `handleTrinketToggle()` to support stackable trinkets
   - Added `handleTrinketIncrement()` and `handleTrinketDecrement()`
   - Added right-click event listener for trinket list
   - Updated `updateDisplay()` to handle new trinket format

4. **js/ui.js**
   - Updated `updateSelectedTrinketsInGrid()` to accept full trinket entries and show count badges

---

## Testing Summary

✅ **Alarm Trinket**: Shows +25% movement speed  
✅ **Blue Bandana**: Shows +8% extraction, -5% skill check (20%)  
✅ **Bone Trinket**: Stackable, +25% per stack, capped at 40 speed  

All automated tests passed. Ready for browser testing!

## Next Steps

**Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5) and test:
1. Alarm trinket shows movement speed boost
2. Blue Bandana shows correct percentages (8% extraction, 20% skill check)
3. Bone trinket can be stacked with left/right clicks and respects 40 speed cap
